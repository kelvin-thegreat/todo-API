# todo-API
The provided code is a simple RESTful web service built using Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python. 
The service allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of tasks. 
It also includes basic HTTP authentication to secure certain endpoints.

## Overview of the functionalities and features

# API Endpoints
1. GET /todo/api/v1.0/tasks/<int:task_id>: Retrieves a specific task by its ID.
2. POST /todo/api/v1.0/tasks: Creates a new task.
3. PUT /todo/api/v1.0/tasks/<int:task_id>: Updates a specific task by its ID.
4. DELETE /todo/api/v1.0/tasks/<int:task_id>: Deletes a specific task by its ID.
5. GET /todo/api/v1.0/tasks: Retrieves a list of all tasks

# Error Handling:
If a task with a specific ID is not found, it returns a 404 Not Found error.
If the data provided for task creation or update is invalid, it returns a 400 Bad Request error.
It also returns appropriate error messages in JSON format.

# Web Service Improvements
The service includes a function make_public_task that generates a "public" version of a task to include the URI of the task.
This makes it easier for clients to consume the API.
The GET /todo/api/v1.0/tasks endpoint now returns the full URI for each task in the list.

# HTTP Basic Authentication
The web service implements HTTP Basic Authentication using flask_httpauth.HTTPBasicAuth.
A username/password combination is required to access certain endpoints.
If unauthorized access is attempted, it returns a 401 Unauthorized error.

# Running the Web Service
The web service is configured to run with the debug mode enabled, which provides helpful debugging messages during development.
The service will listen on the default port (5000) for incoming requests.
